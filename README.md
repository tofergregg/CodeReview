This is a small website that allows Stanford Section Leaders to 
compile and run student code as uploaded from the Bluebook 
computerized exam program.

In addition to these files, you must also put the files from
[https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/src-noconflict](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/src-noconflict)
into the `js/src-noconflict` folder in the website.
